# Embeddings

Embeddings are numerical representations of concepts converted to number sequences.  They can be used to find out how similar words, sentences, or paragraphs are to each other.  They can also be used to find similar lessons or similar code examples.

Embeddings make it easy for computers to understand the relationships between any concepts. They are often used increasing the quality of search results.

From the OpenAI announcement:

*Embeddings make it easy to perform natural language and code tasks like semantic search, clustering, topic modeling, and classification.*

Our embeddings outperform top models in 3 standard benchmarks, including a 20% relative improvement in code search.
