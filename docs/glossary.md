#### Computational Thinking

Computational thinking is a way of solving problems and analyzing data by breaking it down into smaller parts and using algorithms and other tools to solve the problem.

It is a thought process that is used in many different fields, from engineering to economics, and it is often used in computing and programming. Computational thinking involves breaking down a problem into smaller pieces and understanding how the pieces interact with one another, to create a solution.

#### Prompt

#### SVG
SVG means Scalable Vector Graphics.  It is a standard format for generating vector images (not bitmaps) that can be easily generated by ChatGPT.

#### Tokens

Common sequences of characters found in text that are assigned numbers and used as inputs to machine learning models.

The number of tokens in both prompts and responses are added together and must be under the token budget for a NLP model.
