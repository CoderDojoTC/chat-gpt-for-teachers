## Give Examples

Include in your prompt examples of what you are looking for.  If you want a list of things include the first items from a list.

1. Getting started
2. Variables
3. Conditionals

## Ask questions
To ensure the output is relevant and helpful, ask specific questions within the prompt. This will give the model a better understanding of what you’re looking for.

## Output Format
Most systems don't return results in formats such as MS-Word or MS-Powerpoint.  HTML is also hard to read.  Try using markdown format.

## Try Line Art Formats
Refine, refine, refine. To get better results, make sure the prompt is specific and concise. Include the questions you want to ask and the context of the conversation, and think about the tone of the conversation as well.
