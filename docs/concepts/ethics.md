# Ethics of Large Language Models and Generative AI

Not everyone agrees we should use generative AI tools that are trained on the hard work of others.  With any new technology, there are always tradeoffs.

## Topics for discussion

1. Will being able to quickly generate your own curriculum discourage teachers from working together to share content?
2. Will your generated content use current libraries or will they tend to use older libraries that are being deprecated?
3. Are you violating the spirit of open-source communities if you don't visit their websites for help?
4. How can we guarantee we are using best practices in our code?  Can code be too "dense" or have too many comments?
