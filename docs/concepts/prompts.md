# Prompts

Prompts are the commands that we give ChatGPT.  They are formulated in simple English language and are intuitive to create.  You can also tell ChatGPT the output format you want it to return.

## Sample Output Formats

You can add "as a list" or "as a table" to your prompt.

Example: States in the Midwest as a list


## Maximum Length

The ChatGPT released in November 2022 has a maximum length of 4,000 tokens.  We will define exactly what tokens are in our next lesson.
