# Using ChatGPT to Select the Right License

## Why should we be concerned about licenses?

## Legal Issues

1. Sharing with other teachers
2. Attribution
3. Non-commercial

## Sample Prompt

I am a teacher that is creating new lesson plans.  I want other teachers to be able to reuse my content and modify it for their classrooms.  However, I want them to give me attribution and I don't want anyone to be able to resell my content.

What creative commons license should I use?

## Sample Response

The Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) license would be the best option for you. This license allows others to reuse and modify your content for non-commercial purposes, as long as they give you attribution and share their modified content under the same license. It also prevents anyone from reselling your content.

You can then look-up this name and provide a link to it:

[Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
