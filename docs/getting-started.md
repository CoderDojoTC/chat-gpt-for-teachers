# Getting Started

You can get started in just a few minutes.  To use these materials you will need two things:

1. A valid account on either ChatGPT or an account on the OpenAI Playground. [Link to ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat)
2. A place to put the generated content.  We suggest you use GitHub Pages if you would like to share your content with others.  To use GitHub Pages you will need a GitHub account.  [Link to GitHub](http://github.com)

The way this course runs is that the instructor will show you a suggested prompt and then ask you to try that same prompt on your system.  If you are happy with the results, you can then copy and paste the results into your website.
